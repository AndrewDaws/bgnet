# Intro

Hey! Socket programming got you down? Is this stuff just a little too
difficult to figure out from the `man` pages? You want to do cool
Internet programming, but you don't have time to wade through a gob of
`struct`s trying to figure out if you have to call `bind()` before you
`connect()`, etc., etc.

Well, guess what! I've already done this nasty business, and I'm dying
to share the information with everyone! You've come to the right place.
This document should give the average competent C programmer the edge
s/he needs to get a grip on this networking noise.

And check it out: I've finally caught up with the future (just in the
nick of time, too!) and have updated the Guide for IPv6! Enjoy!


## Audience

This document has been written as a tutorial, not a complete reference.
It is probably at its best when read by individuals who are just
starting out with socket programming and are looking for a foothold. It
is certainly not the _complete and total_ guide to sockets programming,
by any means.

Hopefully, though, it'll be just enough for those man pages to start
making sense... `:-)`


## Platform and Compiler

The code contained within this document was compiled on a Linux PC using
Gnu's [ix[compilers!gcc]] `gcc` compiler. It should, however, build on
just about any platform that uses `gcc`. Naturally, this doesn't apply
if you're programming for Windows---see the [section on Windows
programming](#windows), below.

## Note for Solaris/SunOS Programmers {#solaris}

When compiling for [ix[Solaris]] Solaris or [ix[SunOS]] SunOS, you need
to specify some extra command-line switches for linking in the proper
libraries. In order to do this, simply add "`-lnsl -lsocket -lresolv`"
to the end of the compile command, like so:

```
$ cc -o server server.c -lnsl -lsocket -lresolv
```

If you still get errors, you could try further adding a `-lxnet` to the
end of that command line. I don't know what that does, exactly, but some
people seem to need it.

Another place that you might find problems is in the call to
`setsockopt()`. The prototype differs from that on my Linux box, so
instead of:

```{.c}
int yes=1;
```

enter this:

```{.c}
char yes='1';
```

As I don't have a Sun box, I haven't tested any of the above
information---it's just what people have told me through email.


## Note for Windows Programmers {#windows}

At this point in the guide, historically, I've done a bit of bagging on
[ix[Windows]] Windows, simply due to the fact that I don't like it very
much. But I should really be fair and tell you that Windows has a huge
install base and is obviously a perfectly fine operating system.

They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and in this case, I
believe it to be true. (Or maybe it's age.) But what I can say is that
after a decade-plus of not using Microsoft OSes for my personal work,
I'm much happier! As such, I can sit back and safely say, "Sure, feel
free to use Windows!"  ...Ok yes, it does make me grit my teeth to say
that.

So I still encourage you to try [ix[Linux]]
[fl[Linux|https://www.linux.com/]], [fl[BSD|https://bsd.org/]], or some
flavor of Unix, instead.

But people like what they like, and you Windows folk will be pleased to
know that this information is generally applicable to you guys, with a
few minor changes, if any.

One cool thing you can do is install [ix[Cygwin]]
[fl[Cygwin|https://cygwin.com/]], which is a collection of Unix tools
for Windows. I've heard on the grapevine that doing so allows all these
programs to compile unmodified.

Another thing that you should consider is [ix[WSL]] [ix[Windows
Subsystem For Linux]] the [fl[Windows Subsystem for
Linux|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about]]. This
basically allows you to install a Linux VM-ish thing on Windows 10. That
will also definitely get you situated.

But some of you might want to do things the Pure Windows Way. That's
very gutsy of you, and this is what you have to do: run out and get Unix
immediately! No, no---I'm kidding. I'm supposed to be
Windows-friendly(er) these days...

This is what you'll have to do (unless you install
[Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/)!): first, ignore pretty much all of the
system header files I mention in here. All you need to include is:

[ix[Winsock]]

```{.c}
#include <winsock.h>
```

Wait! You also have to make a call to [ixtt[WSAStartup()]]
`WSAStartup()` before doing anything else with the sockets library. The
code to do that looks something like this:

```{.c .numberLines}
#include <winsock.h>

{
    WSADATA wsaData;   // if this doesn't work
    //WSAData wsaData; // then try this instead

    // MAKEWORD(1,1) for Winsock 1.1, MAKEWORD(2,0) for Winsock 2.0:

    if (WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(1,1), &wsaData) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "WSAStartup failed.\n");
        exit(1);
    }
```

You also have to tell your compiler to link in the Winsock library,
usually called `wsock32.lib` or `winsock32.lib`, or `ws2_32.lib` for
Winsock 2.0. Under VC++, this can be done through the `Project` menu,
under `Settings...`. Click the `Link` tab, and look for the box titled
"Object/library modules". Add "wsock32.lib" (or whichever lib is your
preference) to that list.

Or so I hear.

Finally, you need to call [ixtt[WSACleanup()]] `WSACleanup()` when
you're all through with the sockets library. See your online help for
details.

Once you do that, the rest of the examples in this tutorial should
generally apply, with a few exceptions. For one thing, you can't use
`close()` to close a socket---you need to use [ixtt[closesocket()]]
`closesocket()`, instead. Also, [ixtt[select()]] `select()` only works
with socket descriptors, not file descriptors (like `0` for `stdin`).

There is also a socket class that you can use, [ixtt[CSocket]]
`CSocket`. Check your compilers help pages for more information.

To get more information about Winsock, read the [ix[Winsock!FAQ]]
[fl[Winsock FAQ|https://tangentsoft.net/wskfaq/]] and go from there.

Finally, I hear that Windows has no [ixtt[fork()]] `fork()` system call
which is, unfortunately, used in some of my examples. Maybe you have to
link in a POSIX library or something to get it to work, or you can use
[ixtt[CreateProcess()]] `CreateProcess()` instead.  `fork()` takes no
arguments, and `CreateProcess()` takes about 48 billion arguments. If
you're not up to that, the [ixtt[CreateThread()]] `CreateThread()` is a
little easier to digest...unfortunately a discussion about
multithreading is beyond the scope of this document. I can only talk
about so much, you know!


## Email Policy

I'm generally available to help out with [ix[email to Beej]] email
questions so feel free to write in, but I can't guarantee a response. I
lead a pretty busy life and there are times when I just can't answer a
question you have. When that's the case, I usually just delete the
message. It's nothing personal; I just won't ever have the time to give
the detailed answer you require.

As a rule, the more complex the question, the less likely I am to
respond. If you can narrow down your question before mailing it and be
sure to include any pertinent information (like platform, compiler,
error messages you're getting, and anything else you think might help me
troubleshoot), you're much more likely to get a response. For more
pointers, read ESR's document, [fl[How To Ask Questions The Smart
Way|http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html]].

If you don't get a response, hack on it some more, try to find the
answer, and if it's still elusive, then write me again with the
information you've found and hopefully it will be enough for me to help
out.

Now that I've badgered you about how to write and not write me, I'd just
like to let you know that I _fully_ appreciate all the praise the guide
has received over the years. It's a real morale boost, and it gladdens
me to hear that it is being used for good! `:-)` Thank you!
